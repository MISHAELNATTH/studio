Getting started (local)
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/MISHAELNATTH/studio.git
cd studio
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run dev server (hot reload)

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Dev server uses the projectâ€™s configured port (check package.json; e.g. next dev --turbopack -p 9002).

Build for production (static export)

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
Note: this project uses Nextâ€™s static export (output: 'export' in next.config.*) so the build writes static files to out/.

Local preview of production build (optional)

bash
Copy
Edit
npx serve out
# or use a simple static server of your choice
Deploying to Firebase Hosting
Install Firebase CLI (if needed)

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
Initialize hosting (first time)

bash
Copy
Edit
firebase init hosting
When asked:

Choose your Firebase project (or create one)

Set public directory to out

Configure as SPA: Yes

Overwrite index.html: No

Deploy

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
firebase deploy
If you want a nicer .web.app host (for example mishaelnatth.web.app), create a new Firebase project with that project id and deploy to it (you cannot rename an existing project's default .web.app subdomain). You can also connect a custom domain from the Firebase console.

Common troubleshooting
One image not loading in production: Ensure the image file is in public/ and the <img> uses an absolute path like /images/name.png. Firebase hosting is case-sensitive â€” confirm exact filename case. If using Next <Image>, set images.unoptimized: true in next.config for static export.

Favicon still showing default: Replace public/favicon.ico and restart.

Dev overlay (Next/Turbopack): This appears only in dev mode and wonâ€™t show in production.

Scripts (important ones)
npm run dev â€” start dev server (hot reload)

npm run build â€” production build (static export)

npm run start â€” start a Node server (if needed)

npm run deploy â€” (optional) add to package.json as "deploy": "npm run build && firebase deploy" for one-step deploy
